;;; Patterns library for OM, Anders Vinjar
;;;
;;; This library is an adaption of Rick Taube's "Item Streams" (or "Patterns
;;; Streams") as found in Common Music.  Variations of Rick's original "Item
;;; Streams" can be found in other composition environments, notably
;;; SuperColliders "Pattern" classes.
;;;
;;; A good general intro to Item Streams is found in chapter 20 of Rick Taube's
;;; book "Notes from the Metalevel":
